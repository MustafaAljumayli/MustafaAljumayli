## About Mustafa Aljumayli

Software engineer by day, Iron Man by night.
I believe and support the mission of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) creation but...
I also believe there's a great deal of work and responsibility that must be allocated into the safety of ASI.

- 💼 I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Deutsche Bank in Investment Banking Research Technology.
- 📚 I'm currently a Masters of Computer Science (AI Specialization) Student and AI Researcher at Georgia Tech.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on applying to a deferred admission for a MBA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Quantitative Finance for fixed income products and AI for Distributed Systems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could make the world at least 1% better everyday.

- ⚡ Fun fact(s):
  1) At the entry level, It took me 300+ job applications and 3 tech positions at uni to become a SWE.
  2) I geek out on cool software apps, clean code, new ways to use AI, and performant PC builds on a budget.
  3) I have an extremely toxic love-hate relationship with mathematics (I know it's bad for my mental health but I can't stop).
 
- 🔥 Hot take(s):
  1) Full-stack developers are just backend devs who know how to copy React components from Stack Overflow.
  3) AI can't ever replace engineers fully. However, it should be included as part of the tech stack cuz everyone uses it.
  4) AWS is called 'the cloud' because, just like your money, it appears for a second and then vanishes into thin air ☁️.

Started coding in 2018. My ultimate goal is to be an engineer, not just a SWE. I like building anything that helps the world get
to the next step of evolution.

Professional Software Releases: 11

### Background

- Former Startup Founder (future big tech founder): reached $7,000,000 in revenue during college.
- Former real estate agent 🏠.
- Self-taught electronics repair guy and PC builder. 
- Self-taught investor.
- Gamer on a hiatus. Former top 1%'er combat record in Destiny (solo'd the entire Crota raid, knocked Atheon off the map, lighthouse sweat 9x).

#### Current Strengths

- I come from a full-stack background. Now shifting my focus to AI technology and safety.
- I've built apps for mobile, desktop, and the web.
- I can code in any language you need me to code in (I've used most popular languages with exceptions for a few).
- I am a design freak. I've spent the majority of my skill points figuring out ways to design scalable databases and system architectures.
- My top 3-4 programming languages are currently Java, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, C++.
- My top frontend frameworks are React and Angular.
- Hot take, my top full stack framework is NextJS. (Hear me out...I know it sucks for large-scale full stack projects but
  give me this + Tailwind CSS and I'll give you back a professional website within 2 hours tops).
- My top backend frameworks are FastAPI, SQLModel.
- Hate configuring dev environments but surprisingly good at suffering through the process.

#### Current Weaknesses

- Inexperienced in Dart, Go, Swift, Rust, and Kotlin.
- Although I've applied MCP servers as tools for Agentic AI consumption. I need to do more work with developing MCP servers.
